### Basic
| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accessory | Name of the accessory plugin. | BlindsMQTT |
| name | Name for your blinds. | Living Room Blind |
| manufacturer | Manufacturer of your blind | DIY |
| model | Model of your blind. | Prototype |
| serialNumberMAC | Serial number of your blind. | 01.01.01.01 |

### MQTT
#### Basics
| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mqttBrokerUrl| IP Adress of your MQTT Broker | mqtt://192.168.0.10:1883 |
| mqttUsername | Your MQTT Broker username | username |
| mqttPassword | Your MQTT Broker password | password|
| mqttMainTopic | The main topic of your blind | myBlind |

#### Get Topics
Use these variables to set topics to inform the plugin about the current status of your blind. The plugin subscribes these topics. 

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| currentPosition | Topic to get the current position of your blind. The value has to be between 0-100. | GET/currentPosition |
| positionState | Topic to get the current position state of your blind. Custom PositionStates messages from your device can be configured with mqttPositionStateValues.   | GET/positionState |
| targetPosition | Topic to get the target position of your blind. The value has to be between 0-100. | GET/targetPosition |

#### Set Topics
Use these variables to define the topic that the plugin uses to control your blind. The plugin will publish on these topics.

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| targetPosition | Topic to set the target position of your blind. The value has to be between 0-100. | SET/targetPosition |

#### Position State Values
Use this variable to configure custom payloads for positionState messages for your device.

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mqttPositionStateValues | ["DECREASEING_STATE", "INCREASING_STATE", "STOPPED_STATE"] | ["open", "close", "stop"] or ["0", "1", "2"] |


## Usage
Build up your blind. Use MQTT to communicate with homebridge. To explain how it works i will use the values of the examples above.
For example, if you use the home app to open your blind 100%, the plugin will publish `100`
on the topic `myBlind/SET/targetPosition`. The blind should send the current position on the topic `myBlind/GET/currentPosition`, the position state on `myBlind/GET/positionState` an the target position on `myBlind/GET/currentPosition`.
